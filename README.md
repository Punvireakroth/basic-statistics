xbar = x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn / n

## Median

Definition of median

**The value that, assuming the dataset is ordered from smallest to largest, falls in the middle. If there are an even number of values in a dataset, you either report both of the middle two values or their average.**

Thus to find the median value we first need to 
1. Order value from smallest to largest
2. Identify the number that fall in the middle
